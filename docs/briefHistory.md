# Complete History and Variations of Java

## Java Origins and Early History

- **1991**: Java was initiated by James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton as part of the Green Project at Sun Microsystems.
- **1995**: Java 1.0 (initially called Oak) was released by Sun Microsystems. It was designed to be platform-independent, focusing on "write once, run anywhere."

## Java Editions and Their Evolution

### Java SE (Standard Edition)

- **Purpose**: Core Java platform for general-purpose programming.
- **Components**: Includes core libraries (e.g., `java.lang`, `java.util`), JVM, and development tools like `javac` and `java`.
- **Versions**: 
  - Java 1.0 (1995) to Java 1.4 (2002)
  - Java 5 (2004) to Java 20 (2023)

### Java EE (Enterprise Edition) / Jakarta EE

- **Purpose**: Extended Java SE with libraries and APIs for large-scale, distributed, and multi-tiered applications.
- **Components**: Includes additional libraries (e.g., `javax.servlet`, `javax.ejb`, `javax.persistence`).
- **Versions**: 
  - Java EE 5 (2006) to Java EE 8 (2017)
- **Transition to Jakarta EE**: In 2017, Oracle handed over Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation, which rebranded it as Jakarta EE. The transition involved changing the namespace from `javax` to `jakarta`.

### Java ME (Micro Edition)

- **Purpose**: Designed for embedded systems and mobile devices.
- **Components**: Lightweight libraries and APIs tailored for small devices with limited resources.
- **Versions**: 
  - Java ME 1.0 (2000) to Java ME 8.3 (2020)

### JavaFX

- **Purpose**: Designed for building rich internet applications with a lightweight user interface API.
- **Components**: Replaces Swing as the preferred UI framework for desktop applications.
- **Versions**: 
  - JavaFX 1.0 (2008) to JavaFX 17 (2021)

## Key Milestones in Java Versions

- **Java 1.0 (1995)**: Initial release with basic APIs and the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) for building GUIs.
- **Java 2 (1998)**: Introduced Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME. Significant changes in the API and the introduction of Swing for GUI development.
- **Java 5 (2004)**: Introduced generics, metadata (annotations), enumerated types, and the enhanced for-loop.
- **Java 6 (2006)**: Focused on improvements in performance, Web Services, and the addition of scripting support with the inclusion of the Java Compiler API.
- **Java 7 (2011)**: Introduced the try-with-resources statement, diamond operator, and several other language enhancements.
- **Java 8 (2014)**: Major release with the introduction of lambda expressions, the Stream API, and the new date-time API (java.time).
- **Java 9 (2017)**: Introduced the module system (Project Jigsaw), JShell (REPL), and several other enhancements.
- **Java 10 (2018)**: Local-variable type inference (var) introduced.
- **Java 11 (2018)**: Long-term support (LTS) version with new features such as the HTTP Client API and several enhancements.
- **Java 17 (2021)**: Another LTS version with several new features, including pattern matching for switch and sealed classes.
- **Java 20 (2023)**: Latest version with various enhancements and incubating features.

## Transition to Jakarta EE

- **Pre-Jakarta EE**: Known as Java EE (Enterprise Edition), maintained by Oracle. Key APIs included `javax.servlet`, `javax.ejb`, `javax.persistence`, etc.
- **Post-Jakarta EE (2017 onwards)**: The Eclipse Foundation took over, and it was rebranded to Jakarta EE. The namespace was changed from `javax` to `jakarta`. For example, `javax.servlet` became `jakarta.servlet`.

## Summary of Key Transitions

1. **1991-1995**: Development and release of Java 1.0 by Sun Microsystems.
2. **1998**: Introduction of Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME.
3. **2006**: Major Java EE update with Java EE 5.
4. **2017**: Oracle transfers Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation, leading to the creation of Jakarta EE.
5. **2018**: Oracle transitions to a more rapid release cycle, with a new version of Java every six months.

## Current State

- **Java SE**: Continues to be the core of the Java ecosystem, with regular updates and enhancements.
- **Jakarta EE**: The evolution of Java EE under the Eclipse Foundation, continuing to support enterprise application development.
- **Java ME**: Still in use for specialized applications in embedded systems and older mobile platforms.
- **JavaFX**: The preferred framework for modern, rich client applications.

## Conclusion

Java has evolved significantly since its inception, expanding into various editions to cater to different development needs. From the core Java SE to the enterprise capabilities of Java EE (now Jakarta EE), and specialized editions like Java ME and JavaFX, the language has grown to support a wide range of applications and platforms. Understanding this evolution helps in appreciating the flexibility and power of the Java ecosystem.
